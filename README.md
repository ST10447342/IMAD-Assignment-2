# IMAD-Assignment-2
Introduction

I created an app that is similiar to tamagotchi the game that was created in Japan in the year 1996, that is what my app is supposed to imitate within this assignment that was given to us.

I began the project by creating a new project and named it "IMAD Assignment 2" the project was created then i started by creating my title of the UI which wrote 
"Welcome To Pet Simulator", then went to chrome to go find an image of a dog for the first screen i then added an imageview underneath the title of the first screen and it was the image i got from chrome i added the picture to add personality to the UI first screen, then i added a welcome message underneath the imageview underneath that welcome message i added a button that says "Play" and when you press the button it should take you to the second screen i added a code within the button to make the button do that function.

I completed making the first screen to my likings and i went to create a new screen by going to project on the left side of the android studio and right clicking
on the MainActivity and pressed "new" then went to "Activity" and pressed "Empty View Activity" and named it secondscreen and with that i just created a second screen and what i had just done is how you create new screens on Android Studio. I finished creating the new screen and went onto to it to make the UI of the second screen to my own liking, i put an imageview at the top of the page and i put constraints on the imageview, and i added three button underneath this image view and each button had a name which were "Feed", "Play" and "Clean" these buttons will affect the status values this imageview will have once i apply the code for each button. I added the buttons and constrainted them after the buttons i went onto to putting three textviews on the side of the UI and the name for each Textview were "Hunger", "Clean" and "Happiness" these textviews would tell the users what needs the dog will need when you pay the game and the user is going to know which status value the dog will need to be fulfilled, i finished adding the Textviews i added horizontal progress bars next to each Textview and these progress bars would represent the status of the dog the user will be taking care off
