# IMAD-Assignment-2
Introduction

I created an app that is similiar to tamagotchi the game that was created in Japan in the year 1996, that is what my app is supposed to imitate within this assignment that was given to us.

I began the project by creating a new project and named it "IMAD Assignment 2" the project was created then i started by creating my title of the UI which wrote 
"Welcome To Pet Simulator", then went to chrome to go find an image of a dog for the first screen i then added an imageview underneath the title of the first screen and it was the image i got from chrome i added the picture to add personality to the UI first screen, then i added a welcome message underneath the imageview underneath that welcome message i added a button that says "Play" and when you press the button it should take you to the second screen i added a code within the button to make the button do that function.

I completed making the first screen to my likings and i went to create a new screen by going to project on the left side of the android studio and right clicking on the MainActivity and pressed "new" then went to "Activity" and pressed "Empty View Activity" and named it secondscreen and with that i just created a second screen and what i had just done is how you create new screens on Android Studio. I finished creating the new screen and went onto to it to make the UI of the second screen to my own liking, i put an imageview at the top of the page and i put constraints on the imageview, and i added three button underneath this image view and each button had a name which were "Feed", "Play" and "Clean" these buttons will affect the status values this imageview will have once i apply the code for each button. I added the buttons and constrainted them after the buttons i went onto to putting three textviews on the side of the UI and the name for each Textview were "Hunger", "Clean" and "Happiness" these textviews would tell the users what needs the dog will need when you pay the game and the user is going to know which status value the dog will need to be fulfilled, i finished adding the constraints to the Textviews, next thing i added horizontal progress bars next to each Textview and these progress bars would represent the status of the dog the user will be taking care of i added constraints to these progress bars and added Id's to them so i can use them to make a piece of code for this secondscreen once i finished making the UI of the secondscreen to my liking i added a button at the end with the name "Back" added a code to make the button take the user back to the first screen.

I started making code onto the second screen this code i will make would make the progress bars increase once you tap the correct button for what need the dog needs and a code to make the image switch to the action of what button the user will press if the user presses feed the image will change to a dog eating and the status of the dog will increase and the code should do the same to other prgress bars with their respective buttons. I declared the values i needed within my code and started making a code for each button so that it carries out its instructions when the app runs, and then i completed the coding part but was not able to make the code to the best of my ability but the main point of the code was completed. I ran the app and it was to my liking and it was completed when you press any button the progress bar will increase instantly once the button is pressed and when the buttons are pressed the images changes to its respective button to show what the button does and what the dog is supposed to be doing that was the point of my tamagotchi game which i had completed.

I went onto make the design of the entire app look pretty so i created a new drawable and i named it "background", i added the drawable to both screens and added a font to the textview within the first page and the title of the first page to make the welcoming text to the users look presentable and friendly so it shows that it is simply a childs game that is not complicated.
