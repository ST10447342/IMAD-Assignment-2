# IMAD-Assignment-2
Introduction

I created an app that is similiar to tamagotchi the game that was created in Japan in the year 1996, that is what my app is supposed to imitate within this assignment that was given to us.

I began the project by creating a new project and named it "IMAD Assignment 2" the project was created then i started by creating my title of the UI which wrote 
"Welcome To Pet Simulator", then went to chrome to go find an image of a dog for the first screen i then added an imageview underneath the title of the first screen and it was the image i got from chrome i added the picture to add personality to the UI first screen, then i added a welcome message underneath the imageview underneath that welcome message i added a button that says "Play" and when you press the button it should take you to the second screen i added a code within the button to make the button do that function.

I completed making the first screen to my likings and i went to create a new screen by going to project on the left side of the android studio and right clicking
on the Mainactivity
